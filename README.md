# BAC-Calculator

The BAC Calculator is an application meant to measure BAC levels of its users and provide a sentiment analysis on the user's state. Barcodes (or names) are scanned by the app and every 30 minutes to an hour after this input, the app prompts the user with questions on their mental and physical state. Based on the alcohol information provided (such as name of drink, number of drinks drunk, time passed), the app will output advice on how the user should proceed wit their drinking.

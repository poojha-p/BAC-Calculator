# Alcohol Safety and BAC-Calculator App

The BAC Calculator is an application meant to measure BAC levels of its users and provide a sentiment analysis on the user's state. The user inputs what they have drank (ABV and how much has been drank) and records drinking start time, the app prompts the user with questions on their mental and physical state at pre-determined intervals that are both time based and BAC based once drinking has began. Based on the alcohol information provided (such as name of drink, number of drinks drank, time passed) and the user response to prompts, the app will output advice on how the user should proceed with their drinking or contact an emergency contact.
